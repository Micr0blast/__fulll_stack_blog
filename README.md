# Experimental project for learning React + Vite, CI/CD using GitHub Workflows and combined JS and TS

Code is based on Daniel Bugl's book: Modern Full-Stack React Projects

Currently on:
- Implementing E2E testing

Deviations include:
- Using TS for Frontend
- Updated Dependencies
- Extended Backend Model for Users with testing

Lessons learned thus far:
- Split backend and frontend into separate projects with dependencies, especially when using JS and TS for one or the other
- Dependency hell is only as real as you let it
- Git Hooks are awesome!
- Eslint 9 is not a yet a good fit for the book contents.
